# Hosting by PixelServices

Hosting by PixelServices is a carbon-negative hosting platform focused on performance, sustainability, and simplicity. It is designed to meet the needs of developers and game server owners who value both technical reliability and environmental responsibility.

## Sustainable Infrastructure

Our infrastructure is powered entirely by renewable energy. We go beyond carbon neutrality by using a portion of every sale to fund reforestation projects, effectively making our hosting carbon-negative.

- 100% green energy supply
- Tree-planting contributions included with every plan
- Environmentally responsible operations

## High-Performance Hardware

We deploy modern, high-performance hardware to ensure stability and speed for hosted services:

- Latest-generation AMD Ryzen CPUs
- DDR5 RAM for high memory bandwidth and low latency
- High-throughput, low-latency network connectivity

This setup is optimized for demanding workloads such as game servers, web applications, and custom deployments.

## Developer-Oriented Experience

Our platform simplifies hosting and server management without abstracting away the control developers expect. The management panel is designed to be intuitive, fast, and capable of handling complex tasks with minimal overhead.

The interface supports automated deployment, real-time monitoring, and essential controls, all accessible via a clean UI compatible with modern workflows.

## Why It Matters

The hosting industry contributes significantly to global emissions. By choosing a provider that actively offsets more carbon than it produces, you’re not just hosting more efficiently — you're hosting responsibly.
