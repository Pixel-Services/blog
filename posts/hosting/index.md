# Hosting by Pixel Services

Hosting by PixelServices is a carbon-negative hosting platform focused on performance, sustainability, and simplicity. It is designed to meet the needs of developers and game server owners who value both technical reliability and environmental responsibility.

Our infrastructure is powered entirely by renewable energy. We go beyond carbon neutrality by using a portion of every sale to fund reforestation projects, effectively making our hosting carbon-negative.

Moreover, we deploy modern, high-performance hardware to ensure stability and speed for hosted services, featring Latest-gen AMD Ryzen CPUs, DDR5 RAM and low-latency network connectivity.

## Why It Matters

The hosting industry contributes significantly to global emissions. By choosing a provider that actively offsets more carbon than it produces, you’re not just hosting more efficiently — you're hosting responsibly.
